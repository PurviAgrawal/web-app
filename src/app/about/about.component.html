        <p>Project Coswara aims at designing point-of-care diagnosis for respiratory infections.
            The focus is on making the diagnosis in seconds, without having to walk to the clinic, and inexpensive.
            Towards this, we propose using human breath and voice.
            Respiratory infection affects lungs, and this impacts air flow through the vocal tract while we speak.
            The result is a temporary change in the voice quality.
            We all have noticed this in our own voice or that of our dear ones, especially in the flu season.
